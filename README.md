# Rainbow Brain
Data Level Parallelism project for CEPARCO

A modified version of Game of Life inspired by Rainbow Game of Life, Game of Life and Death, and Brian's Brain. Each cell can be Alive, Dying, or Dead. Each Alive or Dying cell can be Red, Green, or Blue. All Alive cells become Dying cells of the same color. If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly 4 Alive cells, it becomes an Alive cell and takes the color of the majority of the neighboring Alive cells. Dead cells still stay the same.
